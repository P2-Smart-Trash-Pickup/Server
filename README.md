Plan:
- We will run the server Using The Lora Protocol since we need to sent data a far and it is the ideal for that.
  It will go to a likely Self hosted Lora translation server, then be forwarded using JSON to our actual webserver.
- The Webserver is going to receive the JSOn files either from a POST request or more like a MQTT subscription.
- It then processes this data and spits out statistics and suggestions on the actual homepage.

Features:
- Route Suggestion
- Plotted Fill levels
- Login page

# Electric Trash pickup

# This Repository is Intended as the Main Software for Our Server

This project focuses on calculating optimal trash collection routes using our algorithm.

It determines how full a trash can is, assesses whether it needs to be emptied, and, if so, calculates the most efficient routes for electric trash vehicles. The algorithm takes weight into account to optimize the collection process.

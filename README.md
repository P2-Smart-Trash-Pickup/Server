# :truck: EV Truck Garbage Collection optimizer:

> This project was developed during our 2nd semester at AAU.  
> It includes both the **algorithm** (detailed below) and a very basic UI featuring a login form and a map preview.  
> Many features were incomplete due to time constraints — see below for a breakdown.

## :white_check_mark: Implemented Features
- Algorithm
- Map Loading & Route Preview
- Basic User Setup & Login Forms

## :x: Missing Features (Due to Time Constraints)
- Real data integration with **InfluxDB** for algorithm input
- Notifications from sensors *(sensor code is in a separate repository)*
- Ability to **modify**, **approve**, or **reject** routes

> **:information_source:Note:**  
> The simulated data used in our testing is too large to include in this repository.  
> To run the project with simulation data, you’ll need to generate or provide your own.

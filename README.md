# Electric Trash pickup

# This Repository is Intended as the Main Software for Our Server

This project focuses on calculating optimal trash collection routes using our algorithm.

It determines how full a trash can is, assesses whether it needs to be emptied, and, if so, calculates the most efficient routes for electric trash vehicles. The algorithm takes weight into account to optimize the collection process.
